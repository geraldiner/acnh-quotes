# Words of Wisdom from Pascal of Animal Crossing: New Horizons
I followed zellwk's tutorial on Node, Express, and MongoDB for a simple CRUD app to build a quote tracker for Pascal from Animal Crossing: New Horizons.

# How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was something assigned by Leon with 100Devs, which I thought to put my own spin on while building.

The tutorial is for [building a simple CRUD app with Node, Express, and MongoDB](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/). These were all terms I've heard before and understood individually, but never together.
 
# Optimizations
(optional)*
 
You don't have to include this section but interviewers *love* that you can not only deliver a final product that looks great but lso functions efficiently. Did you write something then refactor it later and the result was 5x faster than the original implementation? Did you cache your assets? Things that you write in this section are **GREAT** to bring up in interviews and you can use this section as reference when studying for technical interviews!
 
# Lessons Learned:
 
No matter what your experience level, being an engineer means continuously learning. Every time you build something you always have hose *whoa this is awesome* or *fuck yeah I did it!* moments. This is where you should share those moments! Recruiters and interviewers love to see that you're self-aware and passionate about growing.
