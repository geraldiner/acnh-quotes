# Words of Wisdom from Pascal of Animal Crossing: New Horizons
The tutorial is for [building a simple CRUD app with Node, Express, and MongoDB](https://zellwk.com/blog/crud-express-mongodb/). These were all terms I've heard before and understood individually, but never together. I really wanted to learn about backend programming because I'd decided to do a more serious for-fun programming project. (If you've been following my work, any "fun" projects is 99% Animal Crossing-related, so a "more serious for-fun programming project" is a project with more function.)

While the tutorial goes through using quotes from Yoda and Darth Vader of Star Wars, I used Pascal and Pave of Animal Crossing for fun.

# How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, NodeJS, ExpressJS

I started out with initializing a node project with `npm init` and installing `express`.

I went through each of the CRUD requests and added some functionality to it.

* Create - Submit a new quote to be created in the database and shown in the webapge.
* Read - Read information from the backend and display to the webpage.
* Update - With a click of a button, you could replace Pascal's quote with a Pave quote.
* Delete - With a click of a button, you could delete a Pave quote (if one exists).

In polishing the site, I removed the CUD functionality, with the assumption that there wouldn't be many new quotes to be added. And replacing Pascal's quotes with a Pave one didn't really add much value.
 
# Optimizations
The biggest optimization I wanted to address in this project was how to hide any credentials, such as API keys or username/password combos, from Github while making sure I could still deploy to Heroku. 

After reading and listening to a bunch of Youtube videos, it seemed easy enough. But still, it took about an hour to set up. Not bad for my first time.

It was all just a matter of setting up `config variables`.

I really deviated from the tutorial by taking away the actual CUD parts, but while building I still went through them to get the hang of it. In my version, instead of replacing Yoda's quotes with a Darth Vader quote, I replaced Pascal's quote with a [Pave quote](https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Pav%C3%A9)...which really only boils down to: 'Pave must DANCE'.
 
# Lessons Learned:
 
I spent a long time trying to fix an authentication error to MongoDB before realizing it was because I hadn't replaced the template string properly with my credentials. ðŸ™ƒ

The way the tutorial breaks down CRUD really made it clear how to write it in JavaScript, specifically in a Node app. And `express` makes it so easy to handle that. You can specify any handling of request with `app.get` or `app.post` or `app.use`. 

This was also my first time deploying to Heroku, which has always seemed like a scary thing. Now that I've done it, it's not so bad. Really makes me confident in building more web apps.
